# WPS - Portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio website showcasing my background, skills, studies, and projects that I have developed.

To view the final result, you can access the website hosted on GitHub Pages at [https://pachecowillians.github.io/](https://pachecowillians.github.io/).

Before starting the development, a prototype was created in Figma to organize and plan the site's interface. The prototype can be accessed at [https://www.figma.com/file/7Pfru4a5hTF7lrbSqkfmqc/Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/7Pfru4a5hTF7lrbSqkfmqc/Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1).

JavaScript was used to generate the HTML pages dynamically, along with some CSS excerpts, using state management concepts applied to JavaScript and separate files containing page information. To run the project on localhost, an HTTP server is required. During development, the `http-server` package provided by `npm` was used. To install it, run the following command:

```zsh
npm install http-server
```

After installing the HTTP server, navigate to the project folder and run the following command:

```zsh
http-server .
```

This will start the server in the current directory, and you can access it through [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
