# WPS - Portfolio

<br/>

<p align="justify"> 
This project is a website i created to be my personal portfolio. In it i present a little about myself, my history, my skills, studies and projects that i developed.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
In this project, it was GitHub Pages, which allows the site to be hosted on the platform's server. Therefore, to view the final result, just access <a href="https://pachecowillians.github.io/">https://pachecowillians.github.io/</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
It is worth mentioning that, before starting the development of the project, a prototype was created in Figma in order to organize and plan the site's interface, ensuring greater quality in the final result. The prototype created can be accessed at <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/7Pfru4a5hTF7lrbSqkfmqc/Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1">https://www.figma.com/file/7Pfru4a5hTF7lrbSqkfmqc/Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
JavaScript was also used to generate the HTML pages, and some CSS excerpts, dynamically using the concept of state management applied to JavaScript and some files containing the page information. Therefore, in order to run the project on localhost, it must be done within an HTTP server, as browsers only allow this functionality when the code is running through a server. Thus, during the construction of the project, the <code>http-server</code> provided by <code>npm</code> was used. To install it, just run the following code snippet:
</p>

<br/>

```zsh
npm install http-server
```
<br/>

<p align="justify"> 
After installing the HTTP server, just run the following command inside the project folder:
</p>

<br/>

```zsh
http-server .
```

<br/>

<p align="justify"> 
The above command will start the server in the current directory and will generate a link to access server. It can usually be accessed through <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>.
